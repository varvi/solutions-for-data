## About Me

I'm a one-person data force based in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. With a background in Biochemistry, Data Management for Clinical Trials, GCP and ECRIN compliance for clinical trials data, I can become part of your teams to understand your needs, figure out your challenges, and deliver a solution that you will actually use. If you need an external opinion for a larger project that you plan, get me on board to figure out feasibility based on your resources.
When I am out and about to get inspired by nature I love the cold clear weather and climbing peaks with a splitboard.
Recently I published a ski-touring adventure movie in Greece. If you are interested watch ["Xioni"](https://youtu.be/GAzRcDvd91g) on YouTube.
