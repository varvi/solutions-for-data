# Solutions for Data

Welcome! I'm a data scientist and biochemist with a passion for solving real-world problems through analytics, science, and curiosity.

After more than a decade in academic and industrial research, I took a deep dive into the world â€” traveling through Europe and Africa in a van, chasing surf and snow, and reconnecting with a wider lens on life and learning. Now, I combine rigorous data science with systems thinking and lived insight to help mission-driven organizations tackle meaningful challenges.
